# Thompson Knot Theory

## The Thompson group $F$ and the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$
The Thompson group $F$ and the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$ admit infinite presentations, namely 
<p align="center">
$\langle y_0, y_1, ...| y_n y_l = y_l y_{n+1}$ for all $l < n\rangle$ and
$\langle x_0, x_1, ...| x_n x_l = x_l x_{n+2}$ for all $l < n\rangle$
</p>
respectively [CFP, B, Brown].

Every element of $F_3$ can be represented by pairs of ternary trees with the same number of leaves and such pairs are called ternary tree diagrams. 
The representation is non-unique, but there exists a unique minimal representive, that is with minimal number of leaves.

Both contain interesting monoids. The positive monoid $F_+$ of $F$ is the one generated by $y_0$, $y_1$, ...
Similarly, the positive monoid $F_{3,+}$ of $F_3$ is  generated by by $x_0$, $x_1$, ...
The elements of these monoids are called positive.

Every element positive element of $F_3$ can be written uniquely as $x_0^{a_0}\cdots x_n^{a_n}$ for some $n$, $a_0$, ..., $a_{n-1}$ in $\mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ and $a_n\in \mathbb{N}$. We call $n$ the width and $\max_{i}a_i$ the height of the element.

There is a natural injection of $F$ into $F_3$ which is obtained by mapping $y_i$ to $x_{2i}$ for all $i$.
Correspondingly, we have an injection of $F_+$ into $F_{3,+}$.

## Jones construction of knots
In 2014 Vaughan Jones defined a method to construct link from elements of the Thompson group $F$, which was later extended to the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$, [Jo14, Jo18]. Both $F$ and $F_3$ are just as a good as the braid groups at producing links. More precisely, for every link $L$ there exists an element $g$ such that its closure $\mathcal{L}(g)$ is equivalent to $L$.
Here we exemplify the procedure

See [A2] for a survey on this area.

The purpose of this package is to study the knots produced from $F_3$.
