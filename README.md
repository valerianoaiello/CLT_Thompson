# A Central limit theorem for Thompson group $F$

## The Thompson group $F$
The Thompson group $F$ admits an infinite presentations 
<p align="center">
$\langle x_0, x_1, ...| x_n x_l = x_l x_{n+1}$ for all $l < n\rangle$

respectively [CFP, B].

Every element of $F$ can be represented by pairs of binary trees with the same number of leaves and such pairs are called binary tree diagrams. 
The representation is non-unique, but there exists a unique minimal representive, that is with minimal number of leaves.

$F$ contains interesting monoids. The positive monoid $F_+$ of $F$ is the one generated by $x_0$, $x_1$, ...
and its elements are called positive.
